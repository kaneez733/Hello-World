# Hello-World
Welcome to my world. Whole world is full of fresh atmosphere and wind coming all over. My world is may be not same as yours so let's breath in and say aloud "HELLO WORLD".

I am a human not know about nature of myself. But being positive I can say what is negative but be positive and what is positive and always be positive. Here in this case positive naturs of human always wins. I am a proffesionally teacher but I learn one thing students are never so easy because they need bounds. So its starts from home.
